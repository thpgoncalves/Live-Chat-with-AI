## About The Project

This is a FullStack project to build a ChatBot/Virtual Assistant that uses the OpenIA API as the engine for its responses. The Backend was built with Python (Flask) and the FrontEnd with a simple HTML and CSS base and using JavaScript to handle the interactive interface.

## How to use it

#### Create an “.env” file in the root. In this file define the variable “OPENAI_API_KEY” and enter your key for using the OpenAI API (Do not share your key in public files or with other people so as not to generate undue charges).

#### With all the settings correct, access the terminal and do the following sequence of commands:
1. cd backend 

2. python -m venv venv

3. venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) / source venv/bin/activate (Unix or MacOS)

4. pip install -r requirements.txt

5. python app.py

6. Open New Terminal Window

7. cd frontend

8. python -m http.server 8000 (or any other port)

9. Access http://localhost:8000/ (or any other previously configured port)

#### After the commands, the application should be running locally on a predefined access port and look like the screenshot below. Feel free to use your virtual assistant and ask for help whenever you need it.
